     <h2>Unit 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>

<h4> Summary of Learning</h4>
<p>
This first unit provided an introduction to the core principles of machine learning (ML), its relationship with artificial intelligence, and the wider implications of deploying such systems at scale. We discussed how ML is integrated into everyday tools and services, from recommendation engines to automated decision-making. The session also introduced the distinction between Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0—highlighting a shift from automation-focused systems to more human-centric, ethically guided technologies (Metcalf, 2024).
</p>
<p>
A key takeaway from this week was the growing concern around how rapidly implemented ML systems can create unintended risks—particularly when deployed without sufficient consideration for privacy, security, and user impact. As technologies become more integrated into industry and society, their design must reflect not only performance metrics, but also values such as fairness, transparency, and resilience.
</p>

<h4>📁 Artefact</h4>
<p>
For this unit, I contributed to the discussion forum with a post titled <em>“M&S Cyberattack in UK Retail”</em>. In this post, I analysed the April 2025 cyberattack on Marks & Spencer (M&S) as a case study that illustrates how a narrow focus on speed and automation—as typical of Industry 4.0—can expose serious security and ethical vulnerabilities. I drew on Metcalf’s (2024) concept of Industry 5.0 to propose how a more adaptive, human-in-the-loop approach could have reduced the scale of disruption and protected consumer trust.

</p>

<h4>🪞 Reflection (WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT)</h4>
<p>
<strong>What:</strong> The unit introduced machine learning as a key driver in both innovation and risk within modern industry. Analysing the M&S incident helped me understand the real-world consequences when ethical design is overlooked in favour of efficiency or automation.<br><br>

<strong>So What:</strong> This case changed my perception of ML systems—from seeing them as purely technical achievements to understanding them as socio-technical systems. The scale of customer impact and reputational loss at M&S highlighted how quickly trust can break down if systems fail to account for human oversight and resilience (Ravikumar & Young, 2025; Gallagher, 2025).<br><br>

<strong>Now What:</strong> Moving forward, I plan to critically evaluate ML architectures not only for performance, but also for ethical integrity, data protection, and risk mitigation. I also want to explore how principles like redundancy and decentralisation could be designed into future systems, in line with Industry 5.0 values.
</p>

<h4> Collaboration</h4>
<p>
In our team formation session, I helped shape our initial group contract by proposing weekly communication via whatsapp and google meet . We agreed to use shared Google Docs for updates and keep regular check-ins.
</p>

<h4> Evidence</h4>
<p>
My forum post, titled “M&S Cyberattack in UK Retail”, 
  M&S Cyberattack  in UK Retail

 Metcalf talks about how Industry 5.0 is not just about adding more tech or making everything automatic like in Industry 4.0, but more about making systems that think about people, are flexible, and follow ethical ideas(Metcalf, 2024). This is important in areas like retail, where digital changes happened super-fast, but in many cases, they didn’t really think about how to protect workers or customers properly. A lot of systems were built just to be fast or efficient, not to be fair or safe for everyone involved(Metcalf, 2024).

 One serious case that shows how scary  these systems can be happened in April 2025, when Marks & Spencer (M&S), one of the biggest retail companies in the UK, was hit by a major cyberattack. The attackers got into customer data though payment info wasn’t stolen and caused big problems with online shopping and even systems inside physical stores (Ravikumar &  Young, 2025). Experts said the company was losing around £25 to £30 million every week, especially in its clothing and home departments. On top of that, M&S’s share price dropped sharply by about 15% which meant they lost around £1.3 billion in market value (Gallagher, 2025).

 What happened at M&S shows the downside of how Industry 4.0 has been applied—focusing too much on speed, automation, and storing everything in one place, without really thinking about what happens if things go wrong (Heuser,  & B., & Wang, L., 2021). Metcalf’s view of Industry 5.0 goes in a different direction. It’s more about making systems that can adapt, involve human decisions, and are built to be strong against unexpected problems. If M&S had already been using a setup where AI systems worked with human teams, had tools to spot risks early, and didn’t rely on just one central system, maybe the damage wouldn’t have been so massive (Metcalf, 2024).

  The attack seriously damaged customer trust in M&S.  their customers shared their frustration and fear on forums and Trustpilot, mainly about personal data being exposed. This supports research showing that loyalty depends heavily on data security and ethical tech use (Mittelstadt, & Floridi,, 2017)

<h2>Unit 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

<h4>Summary of Learning</h4>
<p>
This unit introduced the foundational principles of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), focusing on the importance of understanding data structure, identifying anomalies, and preparing datasets for machine learning. We reviewed key concepts such as feature distribution, outlier detection, and correlation analysis, and discussed how EDA helps form the basis for accurate and reliable modelling.
</p>
<p>
One of the core insights from this unit was that raw data is rarely ready for immediate use in machine learning. EDA enables practitioners to clean, visualise, and assess data before moving to algorithm development. This step is essential for both supervised and unsupervised learning, ensuring the quality of inputs and improving downstream model performance.
</p>

<h4>Artefact</h4>
<p>
my artefact is a reflective summary and personal notes taken while engaging with the core reading (Bishop & Bishop, 2024, Chapter 3) and lecturecast. I participated in the forum and group chat discussions on EDA techniques, and shared thoughts on how data anomalies can mislead model interpretation if not properly identified. My reflections focused on real-world risks of neglecting EDA in business-critical applications, such as financial forecasting or fraud detection.
</p>

<h4>Reflection (WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT)</h4>
<p>
<strong>What:</strong> I learned that EDA is not simply about generating plots or statistics, but about exploring data with intent. It involves questioning the reliability, relevance, and completeness of the dataset before doing any modelling work.<br><br>

<strong>So What:</strong> This changed my perception of ML workflows. I used to think modelling came first, but now I understand how poor EDA leads to overfitting, biased models, or misleading insights. The reading and peer comments reinforced how common data quality issues are, and how easily they are overlooked without structured analysis.<br><br>

<strong>Now What:</strong> For future assignments, I will build in more time for EDA as a formal process. I also plan to use tools like correlation matrices, summary statistics, and visualisation libraries when I begin working on modelling tasks, even if not required, because I now see their long-term value.
</p>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>
<p>
During the week, I contributed to our team discussion around the importance of data validation in machine learning. I shared insights from the reading and lecturecast, particularly around the concept of "garbage in, garbage out," and how this applies to training models on poorly understood datasets. I also reflected on how EDA can reduce risk in practical applications like medical imaging or credit scoring.
</p>



<h4>Skills & Competencies</h4>

  <li>Strengthened understanding of data integrity and its role in ML performance</li>
  <li>Engaged with peer learning through reflective discussion</li>

<h2>Unit 3 – Correlation and Regression</h2>

<h4>Summary of Learning</h4>
<p>
This week’s content introduced the statistical foundations of correlation and regression. Correlation was examined as a means of quantifying the strength and direction of linear associations between two variables, while regression was explored as a method for constructing predictive relationships. These techniques are essential for supervised learning tasks, especially in understanding how variables interact and how future outcomes can be estimated based on input data.
</p>

<h4>Artefact</h4>
<p>
The unit’s practical exercises were completed through four Jupyter Notebooks: <code>covariance_pearson_correlation.ipynb</code>, <code>linear_regression.ipynb</code>, <code>multiple_linear_regression.ipynb</code>, and <code>polynomial_regression.ipynb</code>. These notebooks covered the implementation of Pearson correlation, simple linear regression, multivariable linear regression, and polynomial curve fitting. The exercises allowed me to visualise relationships, interpret r-values, and apply regression to real-life scenarios using Python libraries.
</p>

<h4>Reflection (WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT)</h4>
<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> I explored how correlation identifies statistical association and how regression estimates the nature of this relationship. This was contextualised through hands-on application with generated and real-world data.</p>
<p><strong>SO WHAT:</strong> This experience taught me to approach relationships in data critically. I recognised the importance of distinguishing statistical correlation from causality, and I gained insight into when linear regression may or may not be appropriate for predictive purposes.</p>
<p><strong>NOW WHAT:</strong> I plan to apply these concepts more systematically in future projects. For example, regression will become a tool not only for prediction but also for selecting relevant features and validating model assumptions early in the pipeline.</p>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>
<p>
Collaboration during this unit involved structured peer discussions focused on interpreting regression outputs and identifying common pitfalls. We examined cases of multicollinearity and discussed model assumptions such as normality of residuals and homoscedasticity. Feedback from peers helped reinforce best practices and revealed different approaches to visualising and evaluating regression results.
