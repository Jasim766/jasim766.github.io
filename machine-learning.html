     <h2>Unit 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>

<h4>Summary of Learning</h4>
<p>
In this opening unit, we explored the fundamental concepts of machine learning (ML) and its growing role in shaping modern industries and everyday life. The unit provided an overview of how ML systems learn from data, the relationship between machine learning and big data, and how algorithmic decision-making is transforming both public and private sectors. The lecturecast and reading materials highlighted the evolution of ML technologies and examined the skills required to work effectively in this field.
</p>
<p>
We also discussed the importance of real-time data availability in improving the performance of ML models. Case studies and examples illustrated how algorithms are already embedded in tasks such as personalisation, automation, and risk profiling. In parallel, we reflected on some of the risks and limitations of using machine learning at scale, such as data bias, transparency challenges, and ethical concerns.
</p>

<h4>Artefact</h4>
<p>
I contributed to the discussion forum with an initial post examining the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal as a real-world example of the ethical risks in data-driven profiling. The post outlined the legal and reputational consequences faced by the organisations involved and raised questions about the accountability of ML systems in public communication and politics.
</p>

<h4>Reflection (WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT)</h4>
<p>
<strong>What:</strong> This week introduced me to the broad scope of machine learning and its influence across different industries. It was my first opportunity to link theoretical learning with a real-world application by critically analysing a known data misuse case.<br><br>

<strong>So What:</strong> The discussion helped me realise that ML is not only a technical discipline but also one that intersects deeply with ethics, law, and public trust. Before this, I tended to think of algorithms mainly as optimisation tools. Now I understand they also carry social and political consequences.<br><br>

<strong>Now What:</strong> Going forward, I intend to incorporate ethical evaluation into all stages of my machine learning projects. This includes paying closer attention to data sourcing, fairness in predictions, and transparency of models, particularly when used in sensitive contexts like healthcare or finance.
</p>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>
<p>
As part of our initial team activity, I contributed to the drafting of the group contract by proposing communication protocols and suggesting weekly task updates via Slack. We also agreed on using shared cloud documents to streamline team coordination. These early decisions laid a strong foundation for our group work and helped clarify expectations.

  <li>Developed a foundational understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning</li>
  <li>Reflected on the ethical implications of data-driven decision-making</li>
