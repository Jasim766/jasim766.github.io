      <h2>Unit 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>

<h4>🧠 Summary of Learning</h4>
<p>This unit introduced the foundations of machine learning, its role in modern industry, and its socio-technical implications. Key concepts included the categories of ML algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), ethical issues in data-driven decision-making, and the significance of big data in enabling autonomous systems. Discussions emphasized the evolution from Industry 4.0 to the human-centric goals of Industry 5.0.</p>

<h4>📁 Artefact</h4>
<p>Initial Discussion Post – I submitted an analysis of the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica incident, highlighting ethical and reputational risks in ML-based profiling. The post connected real-world failure to academic discourse on algorithmic transparency and accountability.</p>

<h4>🪞 Reflection (WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT)</h4>
<p>
<strong>WHAT:</strong> I explored the historical and current applications of ML, and reflected on the ethical dimensions introduced through the discussion forum.<br />
<strong>SO WHAT:</strong> The Cambridge Analytica case challenged my initial view of ML as a purely technical domain, revealing how societal and ethical failures can arise from poor data governance.<br />
<strong>NOW WHAT:</strong> I intend to integrate ethical awareness (fairness, accountability, transparency) into all future ML projects. This shift in perspective will influence how I approach system design in both academic and professional settings.
</p>

<h4>🤝 Collaboration</h4>
<p>I contributed to my team’s initial contract by outlining shared expectations, communication channels, and timelines. We agreed to use Slack and Google Docs for all project coordination. I also engaged in the Unit 1 forum and prepared to respond to peer posts in Unit 2.</p>

<h4>📸 Evidence</h4>
<p>Discussion forum post (PDF), screenshot of our team charter, and notes from the introductory session – all stored in the shared team drive and referenced in the appendix.</p>

<h4>🛠️ Skills & Competencies</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Developed foundational knowledge of machine learning algorithms and their industrial applications</li>
  <li>Gained ethical awareness of data-driven system implications</li>
</ul>
