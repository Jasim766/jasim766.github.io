      <h2>Unit 1: Scientific Method and Ethics</h2>
      <p>This week introduced the core purpose of research: to explore, describe, and explain. I revisited deductive and inductive reasoning, where deduction starts with a general idea and moves toward a specific conclusion, while induction begins with observation and builds up to a theory. I learned that in computing and AI research, both methods are used — but induction is often more practical due to incomplete data or open-ended situations.</p>
      <p>I also studied research ethics through the Menlo Report. Key principles like respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for the law are critical when working with human participants or sensitive data. As part of responsible practice, I reviewed the University’s ethical guidance and began thinking about how to apply these principles to future projects.</p>

      <h2>Unit 2: Research Questions and Literature Review</h2>
      <p>This unit focused on how to define a research question and structure a strong proposal. I learned that the process is iterative — you start with a broad idea, then narrow it through questions and literature. I explored how to conduct a literature review by identifying gaps in existing research and aligning my ideas with real-world problems.</p>
      <p>The challenge was turning general interests into structured, researchable questions. I used Boza’s six-step framework to guide my literature review and started identifying credible sources and analytical angles. This unit helped me see the importance of clarity and focus in any proposal.</p>

      <h2>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods</h2>
      <p>I was introduced to key research paradigms and assumptions — ontology, epistemology, and axiology — and how these influence my approach to methodology. I explored both exploratory and conclusive research designs. Exploratory research helps uncover unknowns, while conclusive research (like descriptive studies) seeks clear answers.</p>
      <p>I also reviewed qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Qualitative methods help interpret meaning and experiences; quantitative methods offer statistical validation. Mixed methods provide balance. This unit shaped my understanding of how research design must be aligned with my research goals and questions.</p>

      <h2>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups, and Observation</h2>
      <p>This week covered practical ways to collect qualitative data. I examined how case studies offer deep insights but may lack generalisability. Focus groups bring out group dynamics and shared perspectives. Observations, whether quantitative or qualitative, allow for natural behavior analysis.</p>
      <p>I considered when each method is useful, especially if I need a rich understanding of user behavior or system interaction. I also submitted my literature review outline, receiving useful feedback that will shape my final review.</p>

      <h2>Unit 5: Interviews, Surveys, and Questionnaire Design</h2>
      <p>In this unit, I learned the difference between interviews, surveys, and questionnaires. Interviews offer in-depth insight but are time-consuming. Surveys provide broader trends, while questionnaires are tools used within surveys. I also discovered that the structure of questions — open vs. closed — affects data quality and how I’ll analyse responses.</p>
      <p>I explored pre-testing and post-testing to compare situations before and after a system or intervention. This method seems especially useful for AI-based tools where you need to measure change over time. I also reflected on what data collection tools suit my own proposal topic about technology’s impact on student learning.</p>
