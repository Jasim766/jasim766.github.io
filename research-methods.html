      <h2>Unit 1: Scientific Method and Ethics</h2>
      <p>This week introduced the core purpose of research: to explore, describe, and explain. I revisited deductive and inductive reasoning, where deduction starts with a general idea and moves toward a specific conclusion, while induction begins with observation and builds up to a theory. I learned that in computing and AI research, both methods are used — but induction is often more practical due to incomplete data or open-ended situations.</p>
      <p>I also studied research ethics through the Menlo Report. Key principles like respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for the law are critical when working with human participants or sensitive data. As part of responsible practice, I reviewed the University’s ethical guidance and began thinking about how to apply these principles to future projects.</p>

      <h2>Unit 2: Research Questions and Literature Review</h2>
      <p>This unit focused on how to define a research question and structure a strong proposal. I learned that the process is iterative — you start with a broad idea, then narrow it through questions and literature. I explored how to conduct a literature review by identifying gaps in existing research and aligning my ideas with real-world problems.</p>
      <p>The challenge was turning general interests into structured, researchable questions. I used Boza’s six-step framework to guide my literature review and started identifying credible sources and analytical angles. This unit helped me see the importance of clarity and focus in any proposal.</p>

      <h2>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods</h2>
      <p>I was introduced to key research paradigms and assumptions — ontology, epistemology, and axiology — and how these influence my approach to methodology. I explored both exploratory and conclusive research designs. Exploratory research helps uncover unknowns, while conclusive research (like descriptive studies) seeks clear answers.</p>
      <p>I also reviewed qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Qualitative methods help interpret meaning and experiences; quantitative methods offer statistical validation. Mixed methods provide balance. This unit shaped my understanding of how research design must be aligned with my research goals and questions.</p>

      <h2>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups, and Observation</h2>
      <p>This week covered practical ways to collect qualitative data. I examined how case studies offer deep insights but may lack generalisability. Focus groups bring out group dynamics and shared perspectives. Observations, whether quantitative or qualitative, allow for natural behavior analysis.</p>
      <p>I considered when each method is useful, especially if I need a rich understanding of user behavior or system interaction. I also submitted my literature review outline, receiving useful feedback that will shape my final review.</p>

      <h2>Unit 5: Interviews, Surveys, and Questionnaire Design</h2>
      <p>In this unit, I learned the difference between interviews, surveys, and questionnaires. Interviews offer in-depth insight but are time-consuming. Surveys provide broader trends, while questionnaires are tools used within surveys. I also discovered that the structure of questions — open vs. closed — affects data quality and how I’ll analyse responses.</p>
      <p>I explored pre-testing and post-testing to compare situations before and after a system or intervention. This method seems especially useful for AI-based tools where you need to measure change over time. I also reflected on what data collection tools suit my own proposal topic about technology’s impact on student learning.</p>
 <h2>Unit 6: Quantitative Methods – Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h2>
    <p>This unit introduced key ideas in quantitative research. I learned that quantitative methods focus on identifying patterns and relationships between measurable variables. I practiced calculating descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation, which help summarise data. I also understood the importance of choosing the right level of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) before analysis.</p>
    <p>The highlight was applying inferential statistics, which allow us to generalise from samples to larger populations. I found it useful to learn about confidence intervals and basic hypothesis testing techniques. This laid the groundwork for more advanced inferential work in the next units.</p>

    <h2>Unit 7: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing</h2>
    <p>This unit built upon the previous one by diving deeper into probability and hypothesis testing. I practiced identifying null and alternative hypotheses and performed t-tests to compare means. I found it helpful to use Excel to conduct these tests and interpret outputs like p-values and confidence intervals.</p>
    <p>I now understand how inferential statistics provide a way to make informed decisions based on sample data, especially when dealing with uncertainty. This unit improved my statistical reasoning and ability to critically evaluate claims based on evidence.</p>

    <h2>Unit 8: Data Analysis and Visualisation</h2>
    <p>This week focused on how to prepare, clean, and analyse data. I explored the difference between qualitative and quantitative datasets and learned that qualitative analysis often begins as soon as data is collected, while quantitative follows a more structured flow. I experimented with different chart types and practiced creating effective visualisations using Excel.</p>
    <p>I also learned how dashboards play a major role in business intelligence by summarising KPIs in real time. Understanding how to choose the right chart and maintain clarity when presenting data was a key takeaway for me.</p>

    <h2>Unit 9: Validity, Reliability and Generalisability</h2>
    <p>This unit covered crucial concepts in research design: validity (accuracy of measurement), reliability (consistency), and generalisability (applicability of results to other settings). I learned that while reliability is necessary for validity, it doesn't guarantee it. I now pay more attention to data collection tools and how their design affects outcomes.</p>
    <p>We also revisited the difference between qualitative and quantitative analysis, considering bias and subjectivity in qualitative data. I reflected on how to ensure transparency and credibility, especially when working with open-ended survey responses or interviews.</p>

    <h2>Unit 10: Research Writing</h2>
    <p>This unit was all about structuring research documents such as dissertations, journal articles, and proposals. I reviewed the components of academic writing – abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, findings, and conclusion – and worked on my own project proposal slides and transcript.</p>
    <p>I learned to avoid informal phrasing and how to blend theory with practical outcomes. This skill is essential for presenting results clearly and persuasively, especially in technical domains like computing and AI.</p>

    <h2>Unit 11: Professional Development and the e-Portfolio</h2>
    <p>This week encouraged us to reflect on our learning journey and professional goals. I reviewed my e-portfolio as a record of achievements and skills, and I used the professional skills matrix to map out my competencies. I appreciated how CPD (Continuous Professional Development) and certifications like AWS, PMI, or CompTIA help sustain career growth.</p>
    <p>I also completed the Learning Loop, which helped me connect what I’ve learned in this module to my long-term academic and career goals. It’s a tool I plan to use even beyond this programme to assess progress and update my action plans.</p>

    <h2>Unit 12: Project Management and Risk Management</h2>
    <p>The final unit explored project management fundamentals. I learned about project life cycles (initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure), and methods like Agile, Waterfall, and Scrum. Understanding Gantt charts, risk matrices, and change control processes helped me visualise how large-scale projects stay on track.</p>
    <p>I also studied how to write risk management plans and handle uncertainties. I realised that not all risks are bad—some open up new opportunities. In tech projects, risk can come from scope creep, stakeholder changes, or poor documentation. Good project managers plan for these, which is something I will apply in future AI and software work.</p>

    <h2>Literature Review Summary</h2>
    <p>My literature review, titled <strong>“The Impact of Modern Technology on Student Learning Experiences in Higher Education”</strong>, explores the role of generative AI in reshaping pedagogy and academic integrity. I focused on tools like ChatGPT and how they’re influencing student engagement, creativity, and critical thinking. The review highlights both benefits and concerns, including over-reliance, inequality of access, and challenges to traditional assessments.</p>
    <p>Feedback suggested that while I had a solid base of regional and global sources, I should further deepen my critical comparisons across studies. This review formed the foundation of my research proposal presentation, which explored practical tools like the AI Literacy Framework and proposed interventions within the UAE education system.</p>
